# Task Scheduling using Genetic Algorithm (GA)

## Project Overview
This project implements a scheduling system using Genetic Algorithm (GA) in Python.

- `schedulingGA1.py` — Task Scheduling for simple subject scheduling.
- `schedulingGA2.py` — Modified version for scheduling computational tasks

This project demonstrates how Genetic Algorithms can be applied to real-world scheduling problems like time management, subject study plans, and task allocation in computing environments.

## About
Scheduling is a critical problem in both real-life scenarios and computing systems. Manual scheduling is time-consuming and often inefficient when dealing with multiple constraints. This project provides a flexible solution to automate scheduling using Genetic Algorithms.
